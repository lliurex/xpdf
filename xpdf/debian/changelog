xpdf (3.00-10) unstable; urgency=high

  * SECURITY UPDATE: fix potential buffer overflow
  * goo/gmem.[ch]: change declarations of gmalloc and grealloc to use size_t
    instead of int; int truncated sizes to 32 bits, which made xpdf still
    vulnerable to integer (and eventually buffer) overflow attacks on 64 bit
    platforms like amd64.
  * Thanks to Marcus Meissner <meissner@suse.de> for providing the patch
    and Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org> for providing the changes for
    Debian in the form of 3.00-9ubuntu2
