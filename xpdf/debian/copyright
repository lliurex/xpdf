 Xpdf is licensed under the GNU General Pulbic License (GPL), version 2
 or 3.  This means that you can distribute derivatives of Xpdf under
 any of the following:
   - GPL v2 only
   - GPL v3 only
   - GPL v2 or v3
 .
 The Xpdf source package includes the text of both GPL versions:
 COPYING for GPL v2, COPYING3 for GPL v3.
 .
 Please note that Xpdf is NOT licensed under "any later version" of the
 GPL, as I have no idea what those versions will look like.
 .
 If you are redistributing unmodified copies of Xpdf (or any of the
 Xpdf tools) in binary form, you need to include all of the
 documentation: README, man pages (or help files), COPYING, and
 COPYING3.
 .
 If you want to incorporate the Xpdf source code into another program
 (or create a modified version of Xpdf), and you are distributing that
 program, you have two options: release your program under the GPL (v2
 and/or v3), or purchase a commercial Xpdf source license.
 .
 If you're interested in commercial licensing, please see the Glyph &
 Cog web site:
